<p>Review: Great food, great ambiance, We were a party of 5. Ordered masala chicken, daal, malai kofta, naan, and roti for main course and ras malai for desert. Food was GREAT, did not have excessive spices or oil and tasted like a home cooked meal. Would absolutely return and recommend this place to my friends.</p>

        <p>Review: I love this restaurant. People say it is expensive, but, my motto is you get what you pay for. I promise after trying this, you will understand the quality is superior. Everytime I order this food it is consistently delicious as well as fresh</p>

        <p>Review: Whether Veg or Non Veg North Indian stuff, I go here with family. Set up in "homely" setting, it is the place to go. Besides for desserts apart from traditional sweets, "Mud Souffle" is popular choice and "hat ke" !</p>

        <p>Review: Its easily one of the best restaurants with good food and ambience. The dishes are very authentic and with good taste. You need to make reservations before hand and walk-in have to wait for very long. Prices are bit high but it does matches with the food.Do try their tandoori items and desserts.</p>

        <p>Review: A very classy nice restaurant. A warm welcoming, followed by an excellent service, with a lot of attention to details on order to please you.
            I took at first a tartare, the beef was excellent. With that I took a glass of the local red wine. Somewhat surprising, it does not taste like anything I have already drunk, but I kinda liked it.</p>
